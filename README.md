# Corruption-Data
Econ Development Project: 

The goal of the below research findings was to point out that corruption is deleterious to the monetary welfare of a country's citizens. We will examine this through interpreting statistical trends of the misallocation of scarce resources with alternative uses, as it pertains to the distribution of a country's GDP into its education sector. Overall we find that corrupt regimes are more likely to allocate a lower amount of resources, relative to their GDP, into these sectors,and suffer from weaker labor productivity as a result. As we see, when labor is less productive GDP per capita of a country falls, and, on a macroeconomic scale, the entire economy suffers
